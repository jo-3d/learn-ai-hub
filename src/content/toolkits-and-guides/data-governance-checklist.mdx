# Healthcare Data Governance Checklist for AI Implementation

## Target Audience
Data Governance Committees, IT Leaders, Data Stewards, Compliance Officers, Legal Counsel, Data Scientists, AI Developers, Clinical Informaticists involved in AI projects.

## Purpose
To provide a structured guide for establishing and maintaining robust data governance practices specifically tailored to the unique requirements and risks associated with using healthcare data in Artificial Intelligence (AI) implementations. This ensures data quality, security, privacy, compliance, and ethical use throughout the AI lifecycle.

<PhaseSection>
## I. Foundational Policies & Framework

### Establish AI-Specific Data Governance Policies
<input type="checkbox" /> Develop or amend existing data governance policies to explicitly address AI use cases.
<input type="checkbox" /> Define clear objectives for AI data governance (e.g., ensure data quality for models, mitigate bias, comply with regulations, protect privacy).

### Integrate with Overall Governance
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure AI data governance aligns with and is integrated into the organization's overall data governance framework and strategy.
<input type="checkbox" /> Clarify reporting structures and decision-making authority for AI data matters.

### Define Roles & Responsibilities
<input type="checkbox" /> Assign specific data stewardship responsibilities for key datasets used in AI (training, validation, production).
<input type="checkbox" /> Define roles for overseeing AI model data inputs/outputs and data quality monitoring.
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure collaboration between Data Governance, IT, Compliance, Legal, Clinical, and AI teams.
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## II. Data Acquisition, Lineage & Provenance for AI

### Define Permissible Data Sources
<input type="checkbox" /> Clearly identify and approve specific internal and external data sources for AI model development and deployment.
<input type="checkbox" /> Establish criteria for vetting third-party data providers (quality, bias, usage rights, compliance).

### Document Data Lineage
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement mechanisms to track the origin, transformations, and movement of data used for training, testing, and running AI models.
<input type="checkbox" /> Maintain auditable records of datasets used for each model version.

### Ensure Data Provenance
<input type="checkbox" /> Verify and document the source and history of data, particularly for external or pooled datasets.
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## III. Data Quality Management for AI

### Define AI-Specific Quality Metrics
<input type="checkbox" /> Establish data quality standards (accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, relevance) critical for the specific AI algorithm and use case.
<input type="checkbox" /> Define thresholds for acceptable data quality for model training and production use.

### Implement Pre-Processing Quality Checks
<input type="checkbox" /> Profile and assess the quality of data before it is used for AI model training or validation.
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement procedures for cleaning, transforming, and standardizing data for AI consumption.

### Monitor Ongoing Data Quality
<input type="checkbox" /> Continuously monitor the quality of data feeding into production AI systems.
<input type="checkbox" /> Establish alerts for significant data quality degradation that could impact AI performance or safety.
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## IV. Data Privacy & Regulatory Compliance for AI

### Ensure Regulatory Adherence
<input type="checkbox" /> Verify all AI data handling processes comply with HIPAA, GDPR (if applicable), CCPA, and other relevant state/federal regulations.
<input type="checkbox" /> Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) or similar privacy reviews for AI projects.

### Implement Robust De-identification/Anonymization
<input type="checkbox" /> Apply appropriate techniques to de-identify or anonymize data used for AI training, especially when broad data access is needed, and document the methods and residual risks.
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure re-identification risks are assessed and mitigated.

### Manage Consent
<input type="checkbox" /> Review patient consent forms and institutional policies regarding secondary use of data for AI development and research (obtain IRB approval where necessary).
<input type="checkbox" /> Establish mechanisms to manage patient consent/opt-out specific to AI applications if required.

### Vendor Compliance (BAAs)
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with AI vendors explicitly cover data handling, privacy, security obligations, and breach notification related to AI processing.
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## V. Data Security for AI

### Implement Access Controls
<input type="checkbox" /> Apply the principle of least privilege for accessing AI datasets and platforms.
<input type="checkbox" /> Use role-based access controls (RBAC) tailored to AI development, validation, and operational roles.

### Secure Data Storage & Transmission
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure encryption of AI data both at rest (in databases, data lakes) and in transit (APIs, network traffic).
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement secure configurations for AI platforms and underlying infrastructure.

### Protect Against Data Leakage
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement safeguards to prevent sensitive data from being inadvertently exposed through model outputs or logs.
<input type="checkbox" /> Secure AI development and testing environments.
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## VI. Metadata Management for AI

### Document AI Datasets
<input type="checkbox" /> Maintain comprehensive metadata for datasets used in AI (definitions, source, lineage, quality rules, usage constraints, de-identification status).
<input type="checkbox" /> Utilize a data catalog or metadata repository to make AI data assets discoverable and understandable.

### Document AI Models
<input type="checkbox" /> Maintain metadata about the AI models themselves (version, training data description, key features, validation metrics, intended use, limitations).
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## VII. Ethical Use & Bias Mitigation

### Establish Ethical Guidelines
<input type="checkbox" /> Develop and enforce ethical principles for data collection and use in AI, focusing on fairness, accountability, and transparency.

### Assess & Mitigate Data Bias
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement procedures to proactively identify potential sources of bias (demographic, socioeconomic, historical) in data used for AI.
<input type="checkbox" /> Apply data preprocessing techniques (e.g., resampling, reweighting) or algorithmic adjustments to mitigate identified biases, documenting the approach.
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure fairness assessments are part of the data validation process for AI.

### Promote Data Transparency
<input type="checkbox" /> Strive for transparency regarding the data used to train and validate critical AI models (within privacy/proprietary constraints).
</PhaseSection>

<PhaseSection>
## VIII. Data Lifecycle Management for AI

### Define Data Retention Policies
<input type="checkbox" /> Establish clear retention schedules for AI training data, validation data, model inputs, and generated outputs, considering regulatory and operational needs.

### Implement Secure Deletion
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure processes are in place for the secure and permanent deletion of AI-related data when it reaches the end of its retention period.

### Manage Dataset Versioning
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement version control for datasets used in AI model training and retraining to ensure reproducibility and traceability.
