As someone who has spent over two decades implementing and managing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, the emergence of agentic AI represents the most significant transformation I've witnessed in healthcare IT. At HIMSS25, it became clear that we're not just talking about another incremental improvement – we're witnessing a fundamental shift in how healthcare technology operates.

## The Evolution of Healthcare IT Work

Having led numerous EHR implementations, I've seen firsthand how technology has transformed healthcare workflows. But agentic AI is different. Unlike traditional automation that simply follows predefined rules, these AI agents can make autonomous decisions and adapt to complex situations. This advancement is reshaping the roles of healthcare IT professionals in fascinating ways.

The most notable change I'm seeing is the shift from implementation to oversight. Where we once focused heavily on system setup and maintenance, our roles are evolving toward AI governance, ethics oversight, and strategic planning. We're becoming the architects of human-AI collaboration rather than just system implementers.

Let me give you a real-world example of this transformation. In the past, our IT teams would spend hours manually monitoring healthcare system interfaces, checking if messages between systems (like lab results or medication orders) were flowing correctly. They'd watch for errors, validate data transfers, and generate reports – often requiring constant attention and overnight shifts.

Now, with agentic AI, we've deployed intelligent systems that monitor these interfaces 24/7. These AI agents don't just watch for problems – they learn from patterns, predict potential issues before they occur, and can even automatically resolve common problems. The IT team's role has shifted from constant monitoring to supervising the AI system, stepping in only for complex issues that require human judgment. This not only makes our operations more efficient but allows our team to focus on more strategic work.

## The Reality of Agentic AI Implementation

From my experience leading digital transformation initiatives, I can tell you that implementing agentic AI isn't as simple as flipping a switch. The challenges are significant, but not insurmountable.

The technical hurdles are what you might expect: making legacy systems play nice with AI, standardizing data formats, and handling real-time processing demands. But the real complexity lies in security and compliance. We're not just thinking about HIPAA anymore – we're considering how AI decisions are authenticated, tracked, and audited.

## The Changing Face of Healthcare IT

The workforce impact has been fascinating to watch. I'm seeing entirely new roles emerge in our field. AI Governance Specialists are becoming as crucial as Database Administrators once were. Clinical AI Integration Coordinators are bridging the gap between healthcare providers and AI systems.

What's even more interesting is how existing roles are transforming. EHR Analysts are becoming AI-EHR Integration Specialists. Interface Engineers are evolving into AI Pipeline Architects. Even our Help Desk teams are transforming into AI-Human Support Coordinators.

## Real-World Impact

Let me share what I'm seeing on the ground. The most immediate impact has been in administrative tasks. AI agents are handling scheduling, documentation, and coding with remarkable efficiency. But it's not just about automation – these systems are learning and adapting to each facility's unique patterns and needs.

In clinical workflows, we're seeing AI agents pre-populate notes, manage follow-ups, and coordinate care team communications. But here's the key: human oversight remains central. We're not replacing healthcare professionals; we're augmenting their capabilities.

Patient engagement has been another game-changer. AI agents are personalizing health reminders, managing pre-visit planning, and handling post-care follow-up in ways that feel both efficient and surprisingly human.

## Looking to the Future

Based on what I'm seeing, the next few years will be transformative. We're already seeing healthcare organizations adopt basic agentic AI for administrative tasks. Yes, there's some resistance – that's natural. But I'm also seeing growing excitement as teams realize the potential.

I expect we'll see AI agents becoming deeply integrated into clinical workflows within the next few years. Specialized healthcare AI platforms will emerge, and we'll develop standardized governance protocols. The really exciting part? Medical education will evolve to include AI collaboration as a core competency.

## My Advice for Healthcare IT Professionals

If you're working in healthcare IT, here's my advice: embrace this change. Focus on understanding AI governance and ethics – these will be crucial skills. Learn about MLOps and build your data science fundamentals. But don't forget the human element.

Look for opportunities to position yourself for AI integration projects. Build cross-functional expertise. And perhaps most importantly, develop your skills in change management. You'll need to help teams adapt to these new technologies while maintaining their focus on patient care.

## Final Thoughts

The integration of agentic AI into healthcare IT represents both a challenge and an opportunity. While some traditional roles will transform, exciting new opportunities are emerging. The key is to embrace this change while ensuring we maintain the human element that makes healthcare meaningful.

Remember: We're not disappearing – we're evolving. We're becoming the architects of a new healthcare technology landscape where humans and AI work together seamlessly. And that's an incredibly exciting transition to be part of.
